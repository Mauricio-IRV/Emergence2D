## How to run the project

1. Please install Godot: Find it here: 
    1. For mac: https://godotengine.org/download/macos/ 
    2. For windows: https://godotengine.org/download/windows/

2. Clone our repo from here: https://github.com/Mauricio-IRV/Emergence2D.git
3. Open Godot and click the <import> button on the top menu bar. Navigate your file system and find the <emergence2d> folder, currently inside the main <Emergence2D>. It should contain a <project.godot> file to work. 
4. Once the folder is open in Godot, you should be able to see the file system
    - From here you can run the code
    - Edit the files
    - Or play the game
5. Alternatively, you should be able to open the files in in any text editor, Godot is preferred though because you can't run and test it otherwise.
