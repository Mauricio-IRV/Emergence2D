## Our Git work flow

1. ## When to branch: 
    -We should work on separate branches at the beginning of a sprint. That is on Monday, but this is only possible if we have very independent tasks which has not been the case so far. I honestly do not  think we need branches

2. ## When  and how to merge: 
    - Typically, we merge on Sundays towards the end of the sprint. That is when we check our respective codes and make sure things work okay. The best way is to do the merging together on one of our laptops and try to resolve conflicts together as they appear. 

3. ## Code review:
    - code review has not been an issue so far. As we ar developing a game, one can see if things are working as expected by just running it. I would, however, welcome the opportunity to review code if we deem it necessary depending on the task.
